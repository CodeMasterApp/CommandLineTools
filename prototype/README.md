# How to test this prototype?
1. Start cloning this repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CodeMasterApp/CommandLineTools
```
2. Navigate to this folder
```sh
cd CommandLineTools
```
3. Compile the `test.cpp` file (optional)
```sh
g++ -o ./test ./test.cpp
```
4. Run the dylib/exec, exe
```sh
./test
```

>Note: \
> We already compiled the test.cpp so you don't have to do it. But if you want to do it yourself please delete the test.dylib file and follow the command in step 3
